# Customer Churn Prediction with Deep Learning - IIITD

Predict customer churn using deep learning models. This repository houses the code and assets required to build a robust deep learning model to forecast customer churn based on a variety of demographic and account-specific factors.

## About the Dataset
The dataset, available on Kaggle as [Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn), covers:

- **Churn Information**: Details on customers who left in the last month.
  
- **Subscribed Services**: Phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, streaming TV, and movies.
  
- **Account Information**: Tenure as a customer, contract type, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges.
  
- **Demographics**: Gender, age range, partnership status, and dependents.
